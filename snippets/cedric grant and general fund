By Ariella Cohen , The Lens staff writer A plan to spend $ 4.2 million in federal disaster-recovery grants on Woldenberg Park in the French Quarter has provoked the ire of community activists who say the money should be spent in areas still suffering from Hurricane Katrina .The $ 4.2 million package includes $ 1.4 million for a new splash pad and playground within the 20-acre park , $ 516,000 to improve signage and sculptures and $ 2.25 million to repair the wharves upon which the park is built .The combined spending is equivalent to about one-fourth of the $ 16 million capital budget for recreational facilities in the Lower 9th Ward .The grants equal a third of the $ 12 million in state and federal funds budgeted by the city for clearing abandoned houses and cleaning blight citywide , and one-fourth of the citys total $ 16 million blight-fighting budget , including $ 4 million from the citys general fund .Critics say that the riverfront destination , a popular tourist attraction , is one of many facilities benefitting from a seemingly ad-hoc system of distributing disaster money that shortchanges the neighborhoods that need the recovery dollars the most .I dont have a problem with tourists .We need them here , Lower 9th Ward organizer Vanessa Gueringer said .But drive around our parts .We live here and where we are , its jacked up .Money for Woldenberg comes from $ 112 million in federal disaster grants set aside by the state for infrastructure and economic-development projects that were not eligible for recovery money through local governments or FEMAs Long Term Community Recovery Program the federal governments primary tool for distributing disaster aid .All governmental and semi-governmental organizations are eligible , including school boards , state universities and economic entities , such the Port of New Orleans , which is in line for $ 13.5 million from the fund , and the organization that manages the Superdome , approved for $ 40 million from the fund .The Audubon Institute manages Woldenberg and is the recipient of the $ 4.2 million .Other Orleans Parish grantees are Delgado University , Southern University at New Orleans , University of New Orleans , Orleans Parish School Board and New Orleans Redevelopment Authority .Unlike the arduous damage assessment process and exacting reimbursement formula that guide FEMA spending , the state is relatively unconstrained in how it chooses to draw down disaster money .We wanted to set up a flexible pool for priorities that werent able to get done in the Long Term Community Recovery Program , so we focused on local government and special infrastructure , former director of the states Office of Community Development Robin Keegan said in an interview with The Lens held shortly before she resigned from her position in November .The Office of Community Development took over management of recovery grants and programs when the Louisiana Recovery Authority closed shop on July 31 , shortly before the 5th anniversary of Katrina .Chief among the few hard and fast federal rules that dictate spending are requirements that disaster grant money only go to facilities that can prove significant storm damages and show that they contribute to federal anti-poverty campaigns by meeting an urgent community need , contributing to the clearance of blight or serving a low-income population By giving the state leeway in how to spend the money , the federal government hopes that state will spend in line with community priorities that cant be predicted from Washington .In creating its program for using the grants , Louisiana preserved that element of self-determination by allowing all government agencies the ability to apply for grants without coordinating .In the case of Woldenberg , for instance , the city administration was not necessarily aware that Audubon had applied for the grant money and is not responsible for the Audubon Institutes request for disaster funds , Deputy Mayor of Facilities , Infrastructure & Community Development Cedric Grant wrote in an email The Landrieu administration did not include the Woldenberg projects on its own list of priority projects , Grant wrote .He emphasized that the city budgeted its recovery dollars with the citys hardest hit areas in mind .From a new state-of-the-art hospital and Joe Brown Park in New Orleans East to the Sanchez Community Center in the Lower 9th Ward , those areas most affected by the flooding are represented in the citys priority list , Grant wrote .Located on some of the New Orleans highest ground , Woldenberg Park did not flood in 2005 .But while damages directly related to the storm were minimal , the park qualifies for the federal block grants because of its use during the disaster as a staging ground for rescue operations with Coast Guard boats docking along its wharves and rescue helicopters landing on the grass , Audubon President and CEO Ron Forman said at a public hearing in 2009 .The park , in the days immediately following Katrinas landfall , and for some weeks later , was literally a war zone , Forman told the handful of people gathered at the Louisiana Recovery Authority hearing .Woldenberg meets the other federal requirement of helping fight poverty because it is open to low-income city residents , Audubon Institute spokeswoman Sarah Burnette said .Everyone uses it : tourists and people who live in the French Quarter , Burnette said .Its open to everyone and everyone takes advantage of it .Urban planner David Dixon created the master plan approved by the City Council last year .He says that investing in downtown New Orleans projects such as Woldenberg is essential to the citys largest job-generator the tourist industry and to improving the quality of life that attracts the kind of people who are creating a more diverse economy .We have to fund the big downtown projects , but its true too that the Lower 9th Ward neighborhoods havent been treated fairly , he said .They should not be competing with the rest of the city for grant money .Yet that is exactly what has happened .The park doesnt appear as a major rebuilding priority on any of the publicly vetted recovery plans made in the aftermath of the storm , and it is not one of Mayor Mitch Landrieus 100 priority projects .Instead , Audubon was able to secure the funding through a bureaucratic process requiring only one public meeting .That 2009 meeting was attended by seven people , including a single city employee , a City Planning Commission staffer , and several neighborhood residents .Urban planner Paul Lambert has done marketplace analysis for waterfront developments across the country .In New Orleans , though , he is best known for directing a neighborhood planning process that focused on designing projects in residential parts of the city that flooded .Four years after he helped complete the $ 2.9 million community-driven , City Council-funded public planning process , very few of the projects envisioned have secured funding to move forward and even fewer completed .What youve see to some extent , either by design or just muddling through , is disaster funding focused on the business core along the river , as opposed to the low - to moderate or even more affluent neighborhoods in the eastern New Orleans and Lakeview , he said .Despite the extensive work he has done planning tourist-driven economic development projects , Lambert questions the logic behind spending recovery money in less affected areas .It never made a heck of a lot of sense to me as to why these projects in the Central Business District , in the tourist areas , were essential to disaster recovery , he said .!-LSB- -RSB- -LRB-

Mayor Mitch Landrieu will hold the third town-hall meeting on the 2015 city budget Thursday night at 6 p.m. in City Council District E , represented by Councilman James Gray .It will be held at Greater St. Stephen Full Gospel Baptist Church , 5600 Read Blvd. .The Lens will live blog the meeting here .As expected , much of the District A meeting , held in Lakeview Wednesday night , focused on the citys crumbling interior roads .A number of attendees came out in support of the Fix My Streets movement , holding signs demanding city action on neighborhood streets .Landrieu estimates that fixing all the citys broken streets as well as the sewer and drainage systems beneath them is a $ 9 billion , 20-year project .He has previously said that the city doesnt have a long-term plan to make all those repairs .Sewerage and Water Board Director Cedric Grant , who also heads up infrastructure management for the city , is negotiating with the federal government for interior street repair funds , according to Landrieu .Robert Lupo , the Lakeview resident behind Fix My Streets , had a diplomatic tone at the meeting .Lupo acknowledged that many of the citys infrastructure problems , including broken streets , have existed for decades and would be prohibitively expensive to fix all at once .He asked only that the city be receptive to people who propose a plan to fix them .Landrieu said he welcomed citizen engagement .Unless we have a long discussion and get a sustainable source of revenue over time , were not going to get there .But we have to , he said .Residents continued to demand that the city come up with new revenue sources to help pay its rising bills including $ 17.5 million to shore up the fire pension system and mandated improvements to Orleans Parish Prison before seeking higher property taxes .Landrieu has come out in favor of a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would allow the city to double tax rates for police and fire services .Several speakers asked the city to take a closer look at its tax rolls starting with properties owned by nonprofit groups , many of which are exempt from property taxes .They said theyd like to see those exemptions ended for properties used for commercial enterprises unrelated to the groups central missions .At first , Landrieu evaded the question , characterizing it as a request to tax all nonprofit properties , including churches and colleges .Later , however , he said the responsibility to identify and tax businesses on nonprofit land lies with Assessor Erroll Williams .Landrieu also said he doubted that this change would bring in more than a few million dollars annually .However , he added , the city should collect that money and he said his administration urges Williams to aggressively pursue the taxes .The bottom line , Landrieu said , is that the city does not have enough money to meet every demand with its $ 500 million general fund budget .If residents want to increase police officers pay , fund firefighters pensions , fix interior roads and make the mandated changes at the jail and Police Department , we need about $ 200 million more than we have .As for the requested tax increases , Landrieu said he prefers to grow the citys budget through new jobs and population growth .Even on our best day of growth , which is eventually how you want to solve problems so you dont have to tax , we still have a gap , he said .#### Live blog , 6 p.m. Thursday Help us report this story Report an error The Lens ' donors and partners may be mentioned or have a stake in the stories we cover .


By Jessica Williams , The Lens staff writer Continuing a two-week trend of top city officials asking for more money in next years budget , leaders of both the Law and the Safety and Permits departments shook their tin cups Tuesday at a City Council budget hearing .And continuing its own trend , the council asked the already cash-strapped departments to do more with less .In addition to law and safety presentations , public benefit corporation officials , including those from New Orleans Building Corp. and the Municipal Yacht Harbor Corp. , outlined their budget plans for the coming year .While council members entreated these presenters to find ways to give the city some of their , officials were quick to cite laws prohibiting the city from gaining profits from corporation revenue .** The Law Department ** ** ** City Attorney Nanette Jolivette-Brown asked the city for a little more than $ 12 million .If approved , the money would hire four more part-time attorneys and additional support staff , which would address an increased caseload caused by a possible switch in prosecution of certain misdemeanors from criminal court to municipal court .These misdemeanors would include first-time marijuana use , among others .As of October , the proposed ordinances were held up because District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro and others wanted to work on the proposals wording .Brown said that each of the citys 12 part-time municipal and traffic attorneys handle 861 cases a month , and if the proposed ordinance is enacted , 16 new cases a day would be added to each attorneys workload .If new attorneys are hired , the workload would go down to 785 cases a month for each attorney .After Brown told the council that each part-time lawyer was paid $ 33,000 annually plus benefits , Councilwoman Stacy Head was quick to ask why part-time lawyers are entitled to benefits packages .The -LSB- advantages -RSB- to the city of having part-time -LSB- attorneys -RSB- would be in part to not have to pay benefits , Head said , calling the benefits a strain on the citys resources .Brown responded that these attorneys are well-experienced and appreciated for their work .This experience doesnt come overnight , she said , but the department would take Heads concerns into consideration .Head also asked why the law department hasnt centralized most of its services and why one executive assistant in the law department receives a $ 50,000 annual salary .Deputy Chief Administrative Officer Cary Grant said that while the department does all of its human resources work in-house , it hasnt gotten that far yet in centralizing the rest of its services , and Jolivette-Brown responded that the executive assistant in question had been with the city for 25 years .In addition to these concerns , Councilman Jon Johnson raised the point that red tape in the current legal process lets illegal liquor permit holders work the system to keep the alcohol flowing in their businesses .Brown agreed , and said that the process needs to be looked at again , and ordinances may have to be amended to stop this .Councilwoman-at-large Jackie Clarkson said that if need be , the protocol should be to yank the permits first , tell us what we need to do later .** Safety and Permits ** ** ** Safety and Permits deputy director Bhola Dhume outlined the departments plans for the Bureau of Ground Transportation , which included an upgraded cab fleet system in which taxi cabs are equipped with GPS systems and credit and debit card machines .He also mentioned getting newer cars , for both safety and aesthetic reasons .These changes would put the city on equal footing with many other big cities across the country , Dhume said .In total , Safety and Permits requested $ 5.7 million in general funds , with $ 1.2 million going towards Ground Transportation .While the council didnt have much insight to offer to the new plans , they were quick to quiz Dhume as to why several standards within the Ground Transportation bureau had not been met , including the regular training of cab drivers , as required in city ordinance .Dhume responded that the last time cab driver training was held was before his time .-LSB- Training -RSB- has to happen , Councilwoman Kristin Giselson Palmer said .She then asked Dhume for a training schedule for the remainder of the year .Palmer also asked Dhume about the current system for inspection of carriage horses and mules , saying that the system isnt working , and that there have been repetitive issues and complaints in the French Quarter regarding these carriages .** Public Benefit Corporations ** _ The New Orleans Building Corp. _ Council President Arnie Fielkow and Clarkson were interested in the future of the New Orleans Building Corp. , to which Director Cedric Grant replied that the Union Passenger Terminal plans will make for a bright future for the corporation and for the city because the terminal will become the hub of one of the key ways that you enter New Orleans other than by car .The agency owns the terminal , as well as the World Trade Center building , its parking garage near the Hilton Hotel and the new Revinventing the Crescent riverfront park now planned downriver of the Gov. Nicholls Street Wharf ._ The Municipal Yacht Harbor Corp. _ Head noted that it is unfair that public-private benefit corporations get to use city property but dont have to pay property taxes , and that to compensate , corporations such as the Municipal Yacht Harbor should spin off some money to the citys general fund .To this , Municipal Yacht Harbor President John Manard said that the city doesnt have the legal right to request money from public benefit corporations .Head then responded that though there is a legal prohibition , it is not an insurmountable hurdle .Fielkow was more concerned with the fact that boathouses are being leased at a rate of $ 3,000 a year , a rate that was set , Manard said , in the 1950s .Fielkow called the low leasing prices a bad business deal for the city .Help us report this story Report an error The Lens ' donors and partners may be mentioned or have a stake in the stories we cover .
