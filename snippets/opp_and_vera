Councilwoman Jackie Clarkson this week became the first city official in New Orleans to publicly endorse a controversial new facility that would add up to 600 additional beds to the new Orleans Parish jail complex under construction .Clarksons backing came Wednesday during a meeting of the City Councils Criminal Justice Committee .Orleans Parish Sheriff Marlin Gusman was at City Hall to update the committee on progress on current construction , including a kitchen and warehouse facility , and a 1,438-bed jail , as well as future plans for a new building and possible renovations .The council in 2011 approved the 1,438-bed facility , and the ordinance approving it said the jail would be used to house all prisoners except for the acutely mentally ill .In a telling moment Wednesday , Gusman noted that even as old jail buildings were being closed and new ones coming on line , a number of needs remain unaddressed : * jail space for the acutely mentally ill ; * a primary medical and dental unit ; * a centralized laundry ; * space for re-entry programs ; * housing for community service inmates ; * space for family visits .Designs from the architecture firm Grace & Hebert , obtained by The Lens last year , show that the proposed third building includes space for each of the unaddressed needs noted by Gusman .We have to have another building for acute mental health , Clarkson said .Clarkson offered her endorsement after Gusman told the committee that the FEMA-funded third building had been part of the original , post-Katrina rebuilding plan at the Orleans Parish jail complex .Gusman was asked by committee Chairwoman Susan Guidry to explain how it was that he and Deputy Mayor Andy Kopplin had been discussing details about the third facility last year without the knowledge of the City Council .Guidry told The Lens that our report on the proposed facility was the first shed heard of it .Gusman , clearly cognizant of Guidrys growing role as a criminal justice leader in New Orleans , said , Weve had conceptual discussions , but not firm talk about the new jail .Letters obtained last year by The Lens between Kopplin and Gusman indicate that those conceptual discussions included specific bed-count numbers for the new facility , even as they were making public pledges to not expand the bed count beyond a council-approved 1,438 .I could not support any plans for additional construction that have not been shown to be the best possible use of that space .Councilwoman Susan Guidry At the time , Kopplin did hedge his public pledge , made before a group of religious leaders in April , with the caveat that the city might want to explore the option of adding more beds for State Department of Corrections prisoners enrolled in re-entry programs .A letter from May of last year from Gusman to Kopplin said the proposed jail would have 106 medical beds ; 164 mental-health beds ; 256 re-entry beds ; and 128 minimum-custody beds .The 1,438 number has become a line in the sand for criminal justice advocates in New Orleans , who have repeatedly demanded that the city not eclipse that bed count number under any circumstance .The decision to cap the bed count at 1,438 came after two years of penal hand-wringing by the Landrieu administration , which put together a Criminal Justice Working Group and brought in outside firepower in the form of criminologist James Austin the man responsible for the 1,438 number .But in accepting Austins recommendation and writing its ordinance based on it , Gusman said the city was also was accepting Austins caveat that the functional capacity of the new jail would actually be 1,284 beds .Current prison best practices call for a 10 percent cushion of empty beds to accommodate the proper classification of prisoners , and to provide flexibility so that , for example , prison officials arent forced to mix genders on prison tiers .The prisoner count at the Orleans Parish Sheriffs Office on Wednesday was 2,231 , Gusman said .The city is putting a lot of faith in two prisoner-reduction gambits to reduce the population to a number that will fit in the new facility .A Vera Institute of Justice pre-trial services program has helped stanch the flow of low-grade criminals into the parish jail , as have New Orleans Police Department policies that now issue summonses for small-time pot charges instead of making arrests .But its an open question whether a jail population that has dropped from an average daily inmate count of 6,288 in 2005 to 2,804 in 2012 will drop to 1,284 by February , when the new jail facility will open and all others are scheduled to be phased out .Gusman told Guidry he could accommodate the unaddressed needs by renovating other buildings .But , he said , You asked me to come here to talk about future construction .We offered the sheriff the opportunity to present his proposal for additional beds to the working group last summer so it could be evaluated , and that offer still stands .mayoral spokesman Ryan Berni .Gusman added that in his initial meetings with FEMA officials after Hurricane Katrina , the new facility now under consideration was part of the proposed overall rebuilding project , and that FEMA would pay for it .Jail architect Gerald Hebert was on hand for the committee meeting and said the city was missing out on a huge opportunity to have the federal government pay for a building that would contain space dedicated to prisoners with medical and acute mental health issues .The approved jail being built contains small satellite medical units on each floor , but no centralized medical facility .Further , Gusman said that the new central plant that powers the facilities was paid for by FEMA , and that it was built to accommodate the third building .He said that under FEMA rules , if the city didnt build this new jail , the cost of that plant would have to be paid for by the Law Enforcement District .A statement from FEMA provided clarification on that point Friday afternoon .The central plant , it said , is part of the new kitchen and warehouse facility and its cost is wrapped in to the $ 63.3 million that FEMA has obligated for that building.FEMA agreed to pay for the central plant based on the restoration of three facilities , including a former lockup where the proposed third facility would be built .As each facility is rebuilt , FEMA will incrementally fund the portion of the central plant as it relates to the eligible facility , it said .If a facility is not rebuilt , FEMAs participation in the central plant will be capped at the value of the existing restored facilities .The Law Enforcement District provides funding to the Orleans Parish Sheriffs Office through bonds paid for from property taxes .That third building had been awkwardly edited out of previous drawings Gusman gave to the council .Gusman once famously quipped that the lot could be as green space .And again on Wednesday , a photocopied packet of materials provided by Gusman contains a diagram that hides the building behind a big square block .Lets talk about that big square in the middle , Guidry said .Guidry acknowledged that the council excluded space for the acutely mentally ill in the ordinance .We need to provide for that .In an email to The Lens Friday , Guidry said she was going along with Gusmans assertion that any discussion of a third facility is strictly theoretical at this point .She added that if plans were developed for the building , that theyd be reviewed by the Criminal Justice Working Group and the City Planning Commission before coming to a vote at the council .Guidry is a member of the working group .While I understand that it would be impractical for the housing unit to be disconnected from the kitchen and warehouse , she said , and that there is a desperate need for improved mental health treatment services in the jail , I could not support any plans for additional construction that have not been shown to be the best possible use of that space .Mayor Mitch Landrieu spokesman Ryan Berni said the administration had consistently taken the position that more work needed to be done to determine whether the 1,438 figure was adequate to the citys needs .We offered the sheriff the opportunity to present his proposal for additional beds to the working group last summer so it could be evaluated , and that offer still stands , Berni said in an email .Clarkson did not respond to several attempts for further comment after the meeting ._ Update : A statement from FEMA has been added

Mayor Mitch Landrieus Criminal Justice Working Group will meet Monday at City Hall for the first time since Oct. 19 .The meeting will feature testimony from James Austin , President of the JFA Institute , a national prison-research think tank that has been advising city leaders about prison issues since 2010 .The meeting is scheduled for 1:30 in the eighth-floor Homeland Security conference room .Austin was included in previous working group meetings that hashed out plans for a new , FEMA-funded , 1,438-bed jail now under construction along Interstate 10 .That lockup is also known as the Phase II building .Phase I is the nearly complete kitchen and warehouse facility that also lies along I-10 .A city-owned lot between the buildings has been identified by The Lens as the possible location for an additional Phase III jail that would eclipse the 1,438 figure by up to 650 additional beds .Austin is scheduled to give an update on jail population projections at Orleans Parish Prison , according to a city-posted agenda available on its website .This would be the third time Austins organization has revised its projections .The last projections were submitted to the working group in October .The institute offered a pair of charts comparing 10-year prisoner population forecasts for Orleans Parish .One chart is a policy simulation that anticipates the arrival and impact of the Vera Institute for Justices pretrial services program , and also assumes a reduction in the number of State Department of Corrections inmates doing time at Orleans Parish Prison .That chart concludes that over the next eight years , with those two factors included in the number-crunching , the average daily inmate count at Orleans Parish Prison would be 1,753 .The other chart doesnt include those mitigating factors and anticipated a daily prisoner count of 3,120 over the same period .Under either projection , the jail under construction is coming up short by a minimum of about 300 beds .The bed count at the Phase II jail was capped by city ordinance at 1,438 .The ordinance also mandates that all other lockups in the Orleans Parish Prison system be decommissioned or destroyed when the new jail comes on-line in 2014 .The city law also gives Orleans Parish Sheriff Marlin Gusman up to 18 months to close the FEMA-funded Temporary Detention Center .The sprawling Mid-City jail complex was already shrinking in size and population before the working group last met on Oct. 19 .The pace of change has quickened since then .In the intervening months , Orleans Parish Sheriff Marlin Gusman closed the decrepit House of Detention to inmates .About 400 state prisoners serving time there were transferred to other Louisiana facilities .That left the prison complex with about 2,600 inmates per day , Gusman said recently Citing deplorable conditions , in March , U.S. Marshals removed all federal prisoners from Orleans Parish Prison .The jail had averaged about 100 federal inmates a day , according to the JFA Institute population charts .In late April , the Vera Institute also started its pretrial diversion program .City officials and criminal-justice advocates are hopeful that Veras screening process will ease the strain on Orleans Parish Prison by helping judges make determinations that would divert low-level offenders from jail .Veras New Orleans Director , Jon Wool , said he had been speaking with Austin in advance of the Monday meeting .Austin did not return calls for comment .Stressing that his data is drawn from a short time frame and a limited pool of about 1,000 arrestees , Wool said , Of those that we are assessing , we are seeing about 30 percent released at or near their first appearance .Two-thirds of those released are let go without having to pay a monetary bond .The remaining third has to pay $ 325 or less to get out , Wool said .That should give you a sense , but were a long way from understanding how many jail beds are saved every day , by the Vera Institutes work , he said .Other jail-bed savings may accrue , said Wool , if the Vera program expands to include a larger group of arrestees than it currently assesses .Vera is only assessing about 55 percent of felony arrestees , he said , and nobody who is charged with a state misdemeanor .Wool echoed an argument prevalent among criminal-justice activists opposed to additional jail facilities : The 1,438 figure was supposed to include every class of criminal , absent those with severe mental illness .According to FEMA , the 1,438 figure represents the total number of inmates who were housed at two lockups that previously stood on the lot and were damaged in Katrina-related flooding .Under FEMA guidelines , new construction must essentially replicate whatever came before it , said Marc Ehrhardt , a spokesman for Gusman with the Ehrhardt Group public relations company .The Mayors Criminal Justice Working Group first met in early 2010 and has held about a half-dozen meetings since then .It was charged with determining an optimal size for the Orleans Parish Prison by November 2010 ; it has yet to do so .The Phase III documents for 650 new beds include 256 beds dedicated to prisoners completing state terms in a local re-entry program .The Austin population chart anticipates an average of 200 state prisoners per year at Orleans Parish Prison through 2020 .Additional beds in the Phase III plan are devoted to severely mentally ill arrestees and prisoners requiring medical attention , and other special-needs populations .Chief Administrative Officer Andy Kopplin is chairman of the Criminal Justice Working Group .Councilwoman Susan Guidry is also a member .She said she was unaware of discussion about a Phase III jail until The Lens brought it to her attention .Guidry is hosting the last of her mid-year Criminal Justice and Budget Committee combined meetings on Wednesday , two days after the working group meets .Criminal-justice activists who have been demanding that the city stick to the 1,438 figure will be attending the meeting to remind Gusman and other city leaders of the cap .Help us report this story Report an error

By Tom Gogola , The Lens staff writer | It was the eve of National Lemonade Day in the state of Louisiana and the day that the notorious Orleans Parish Prison House of Detention was emptied of its last prisoners .Orleans Parish Sheriff Marlin Gusman invited reporters to the corner of Perdido and South Dupre streets Friday morning to enjoy the gratis beverage his staff had made for the occasion , quipping that he was trying to make lemons into lemonade at the jail and prison system under his control .!-LSB- -RSB- -LRB- http://s142469.gridserver.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gusman-pretrial-detention-320x174.jpg -RRB- City Councilwoman Susan Guidry , left and Dana Kaplan of the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana , right talk with Sheriff Marlin Gusman after a Friday news conference .Photo by Tom Gogola Gusman said he called the Friday morning news conference for two reasons : to mark the permanent closure of the House of Detention , and to offer a tour of the Intake and Processing Center , where a newly created pretrial services program has just gotten underway this week , at the urging of and participation with the Vera Institute of Justice .Joined by City Councilwoman Susan Guidry , juvenile-justice activist Dana Kaplan , Jon Wool from the Vera Institute , Gusman said the last of the House of Detention prisoners had been moved to other facilities that morning , three weeks after he announced his intention to empty the city-owned facility of inmates .He suggested the city implode the building , along with the empty Community Correctional Center , which it also owns .Until then , the House of Detention has some useful infrastructure that Gusman said hed continue to use as work is completed on a new kitchen building nearby .Besides the kitchen facilities , the House of Detention has a laundry and room for attorney-client meetings and other visits .On Thursday , an agreement was reached between Gusman and the New Orleans Public Defenders Office that aimed to solve a persistent complaint from defense attorneys about a lack of constitutionally required prisoner-attorney confidentiality at the jail .Part of the agreement , negotiated under a 72-hour deadline presented to Gusman and defense attorneys on Monday by Civil District Court Judge Kern Reese , is to use the House of Detention space for meetings with prisoners housed in The Tents .That temporary space does not offer places for private meetings .The House of Detention will be fully phased out of commission once the new jail being constructed on Perdido Street is complete .A new kitchen facility is also being constructed nearby which will render the House of Detention facility superfluous .The House of Detention housed about 700 prisoners , and in a statement issued through the Ehrhardt Group public relations company , Gusman noted that since April 10 , more than 690 parish inmates have been placed in new housing locations and 400 state inmates have been transferred to the Louisiana Dept. of Corrections .State inmates had been housed throughout the complex of other jail buildings , and their beds were taken by inmates doing parish time in the House of Detention as the state inmates were shipped off .The pretrial services program touted by Gusman was implemented in conjunction with the Vera Institute , which now puts assessment specialists inside the Intake Center .Prisoners in orange greeted the sheriff with a friendly hello as reporters entered the facility , a cavernous room that once housed kitchen facilities for the jail .About half the room is a holding cell area for inmates awaiting their assessment , and the Vera Institute works with deputies in part of the other half of the building .The Vera Institute is performing assessments on persons entering into the Orleans Parish Prison as a way to give judges as better sense of the inmates who come before them for arraignment and bail hearings .The program has been running only since Monday .Project Director Lisa Simpson said that they had been working from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays , focused on assessing the overnight bookings and may expand to include daytime and weekend bookings .She stressed that the goal was to assess everyone , but that the program was just starting .She also made a point to say that the purpose of the program was to fairly assess prisoners , and not tell judges that they should release everyone on their own recognizance .Simpson said the organization does an inmate profile but does not make a recommendation to the judge assigned to set bail .They ask the prisoner questions about whether they have children and about their standing in their community , and other biographical detail .The Vera Institute also completes a separate objective risk assessment , Simpson said , to determine a prisoners risk of violent behavior ; prisoners are ranked on a low-medium-high ranking of that risk .The goal , said Simpson , is to help judges determine the bail , even if the judge determines that a prisoner ought to be jailed until trial .When asked to offer an assessment of the programs implementation so far , Jon Wool , director of the New Orleans Vera Institute , said it was too soon to say .He noted that judges and commissioners were eager for the initiative during its recent , five-week trial run , and appreciative of the effort to better screen inmates before they get to court .In his statement to reporters , Gusman said New Orleanians need to be realistic about the city we live in and spoke about the non-fatal Hollygrove shooting yesterday of a 13-year-old boy who was getting off the bus .The city is engaged in a relentless struggle with violent crime , he said , before opening the doors to the Intake and Processing Center and letting the reporters in .Help us report this story Report an error The Lens ' donors and partners may be mentioned or have a stake in the stories we cover .


New Orleans criminal-justice reform advocates are lambasting a plan that would add up to 650 beds to the upgraded Orleans Parish Prison complex under construction along Perdido Street .The new jail would represent a departure from city officials pledges to keep the total number of inmates to 1,438 .That pledge was made April 24 by a quartet of city leaders during a meeting of the faith-based Micah Project .The promise was made by Sheriff Marlin Gusman , a representative from Councilwoman Susan Guidrys office , Deputy Mayor Andy Kopplin , and city Crime Commissioner James Carter .Within a month of that meeting , Kopplin and Gusman were in discussions about adding up to 650 beds in an entirely new facility between the two buildings now under construction .The Phase I building is the kitchen and warehouse building nearing completion along I-10 ; Phase II is the new inmate housing facility now under construction .The Lens asked Mayor Mitch Landrieu for his position on the possible new facility , but Landrieu spokesman Ryan Berni sidestepped the issue .There is no formal proposal to be weighed in on at this time , he said in a statement .Others with an eye on the criminal-justice system were more direct .We are very concerned , Micah Project Executive Director Daniel Schwartz said .What we are reading now contradicts that pledge , so we will have to revisit this issue .We are disappointed , and we need to make sure that that pledges made by the city to the community are honored .The Southern Poverty Law Center released a statement condemning the proposal generally and Gusman in particular .The organization claimed Gusman has been unable to protect the almost 3,000 people already in his custody from brutal abuses often meted out by his own employees .The law center sued Gusman earlier this year over the violent conditions in the jails under his control .Before we put any more people in his custody , we need assurances from the sheriff that the brutal conditions inside of OPP are being seriously addressed , the statement reads .In a follow-up interview , Southern Poverty Law Center attorney Katie Schwartzmann agreed that the City Council and the Mayors Criminal Justice Working Group share the blame for not being up front with New Orleanians about the Phase III jail under consideration .The Lens obtained designs specs and other correspondence related to the proposed building through a public-records request filed with Kopplin in late May .According to a May 25 letter from Gusman to Kopplin , the proposed jail would have 106 medical beds ; 164 mental-health beds ; 256 re-entry beds ; and 128 minimum-custody beds .These would be mostly dormitories with the exception of special housing for Medical and Mental Health , Gusman wrote .This issue has not been discussed publicly , Schwartzmann said .The conversation about expanding bed capacity needs to be more transparent .This directly contradicts what city leaders have said it is important for the city and the Mayors -LSB- Criminal Justice -RSB- Working Group to reconvene and let us have a public dialogue .That panel has not scheduled its next meeting .It last convened in October and discussed a cap between 1,750 and 3,000-plus total beds .Kopplin runs the group ; Guidry is a member .The jail working group agreed there was still work to be done as it relates to future use of city-owned property and evaluating how many additional jail beds will be needed for local prisoners , state DOC prisoners , reentry programs and mental health and substance abuse bed , Berni said .City officials and criminal justice reform advocates are betting that the Vera Institute of Justices pretrial program , which started recently at the jail , will result in fewer inmates .That program is intended to give judges more information regarding the risk posed by arrestees .If fewer people are deemed dangerous , more could be released on reduced or no bond .We have supported the pre-trial services program and funded it in our budget , Berni said .It is too early to tell what impact it will have on the long-term size of the Orleans Parish Prison .Gusmans office released a statement saying that the complex needs to be improved .Eight years after Hurricane Katrina , the OPSOs medical facilities continue to operate out of trailers , but we have worked to earn accreditation and improve our own processes as we attempt to help some of the poorest and sickest members of our community , as they are brought into our custody , the statement reads .The OPSO operates the largest mental health facility in the city of New Orleans not by choice , but by necessity .The federal government has expressed the need for expanded mental health services in our jail facilities .The 1,438 figure has become something of a totem for criminal justice reform advocates , who equate a hard number with a set of expectations about the citys efforts to square public safety with prisoners civil and human rights .One of those expectations is that the city operate transparently .Its not surprising to me how secretive these people are , said prisoners-rights advocate Norris Henderson .I think it is a betrayal to all of the folks who have been having this discussion over the past couple of years .It goes contrary to what the ordinance lays out you are going against the ordinance .You are going contrary to what the law says .Not so , Berni said .We have consistently said that we believe additional beds may be needed to help transition Orleans Parish residents back into the workforce , he said , and to provide higher quality substance abuse , mental health , and medical services for those in prison .Help us report this story Report an error The Lens ' donors and partners may be mentioned or have a stake in the stories we cover .


In response to community concerns , the New Orleans City Council on Thursday said it will delay final action to let the Orleans Parish Sheriff greatly expand his prison .Though council members approved a zoning matter for the prison Thursday , they said they will wait to vote on a related measure until a newly formed mayoral advisory group studies the issue and makes a recommendation .In advance of the council meeting , the American Civil Liberties Union issued a statement asking that the council reject the plan to increase the capacity to more than 5,800 beds .That statement came after a report by the Mid City Neighborhood Association said that Sheriff Marlin Gusman had informed the group that the new jail will have 4,500 beds but the filing with the City Planning Commission indicates there will be 5,832 beds .Residents lined up at the podium to speak against the proposal , demanding that the issues be brought before a vote of the people .Gusman was not at the meeting .Albert Chui Clark called it business as usual , but Councilwoman Jacquelyn Clarkson insisted the people had spoken with a 3-to-1 vote in favor a bond issue .Speaking on behalf of the ACLU , attorney Barry Gerharz stressed the need for the advisory group to make decisions based on evidence and expertise , not politics According to the ACLU , the proposed prison would create the largest per-capita prison in the country .Councilman Arnie Fielkow answered the opposition by stating emphatically , Your voices are being heard that is why it is being slowed down Councilwoman Stacy Head , whose district includes the prison near Tulane Avenue and Broad Street , said the advisory group is a sign of new collaboration between all parties interested in the criminal justice system .This group will start immediately evaluating the proper sizing of any to-be-constructed prison facilities , along with other necessary considerations that impact the size of the prison , including payment methods , arrest and detention policies and alternatives to pre-trial detention , she said.I believe that the current structure of this group will allow meaningful debate and different perspectives to be considered .The group will include a representative from the mayors office ; a yet-to-be-hired criminal justice coordinator ; the deputy mayor in charge of capital projects ; and representatives from the city attorneys office , the police department , district attorneys office , the sheriffs office , Heads council office , the councils criminal justice committee , Safe Streets/Strong Communities , and The New Orleans Crime Coalition .Technical assistance will be provide by The Vera Institute , the deans of the local law schools and a representative from the U.S. Department of Justice .Help us report this story Report an error The Lens ' donors and partners may be mentioned or have a stake in the stories we cover .


As city leaders debate how much to fund the program meant to reduce the number of pretrial detainees in Orleans Parish Prison , Criminal District Court Judge Julian Parker has handed down an order requiring financial bonds for any defendant set to be tried in his court .Parkers order means that every defendant must put up a bond or pay a bail bondsman to get out of jail before trial including arrestees that the Vera Institutes pretrial services program rates as low-risk for fleeing or being re-arrested .The only exception is if Parker authorizes it in writing .First appearances before a magistrate typically take place within a day of arrest .But in New Orleans , felony defendants then wait 40 days on average to appear before a district court judge for arraignment.The judges reasoning , as spelled out in the Oct. 1 order : There have been several career criminals , dangerous criminals , and/or multiple felony offenders who have been released from custody on non-financial bonds .Think of the discrimination here , said New Orleans City Councilwoman Susan Guidry , a proponent of pretrial services and chair of the councils Criminal Justice Committee .A poor defendant who happens to have his case allotted to Judge Parkers section would not have a chance of getting a bail that doesnt involve paying money .Guidry said Parker forwarded the order to each member of the New Orleans City Council just before it started hearings on the citys 2014 budget .Mayor Mitch Landrieu has proposed a budget of $ 584,000 for pretrial services ; its included in his offices budget and will be part of a review Wednesday morning .That is $ 100,000 above this years budget .The budget for Criminal District Court , on the other hand , was cut by 30 percent this year .The proposed 2014 budget would keep its funding at the current level .I dont know what the message was in sending the order , Guidry said .In any case , she said , the program is supported by the mayor and the council .Parker issued a similar order in October 2012 , unreported at the time .Guidry said she did not know if the policy has been in effect since then .Though Parkers secretary said he was interested in commenting on the issue , he did not respond to repeated email and phone messages .Criminal District Court Judicial Administrator Robert Kazik did not respond to questions about the policy , including whether other judges have issued similar orders .#### Vera program aims to base bail on flight , arrest risk The pretrial services program , run since 2012 by the Vera Institute of Justice from Orleans Parish Prisons Intake and Processing Center , evaluates arrestees likelihood of being arrested again or failing to appear in court .The program is supposed to ensure that inmates are released or detained based on that risk , not their ability to pay a sizable bail .The program assigns each person a risk score based on his or her charges , criminal history and other factors .Those reports are provided to the magistrate or magistrate commissioner for reference in setting a bond .There is pressure from certain groups , including the bail bondsmen , to do away with the program or diminish it .There are certain high-profile cases , like Akein Scott , that would chill any magistrate .Jon Wool , Vera InstituteOver the past two years , the service has been the subject of a coordinated opposition campaign by the commercial bail bond industry , a few local churches and an organization called ReviveNola , run by political consultant Kevin Stuart .And , for the second year , the program has become a focus of debate during the citys budget hearings .Judges with the Municipal Court and the Criminal District Court have recommended defunding pretrial services and using the savings to offset anticipated deficits to their own budgets during the current budget hearings .#### Fewer inmates being released on low bonds According to a Vera analysis , the percentage of arrestees who are assessed as low-risk and released on non-financial bonds or those under $ 2,500 has plummeted recently from well over 30 percent in late 2012 and early 2013 to less than 20 percent in some recent months .Meanwhile , as the size of Orleans Parish Prison has become a serious budget concern , the jails pretrial population , which reached a low of about 1,300 in April , was back up to about 1,500 in September .Im not sure if thats all attributable to a greater reticence on the part of the court .There are other things at play for sure , said Jon Wool , director of Veras New Orleans office .There is pressure from certain groups , including the bail bondsmen , to do away with the program or diminish it , he said .There are certain high-profile cases , like Akein Scott , that would chill any magistrate .As NOLA.com / The Times-Picayune reported , the accused Mothers Day second-line shooter had been rated low-risk after being arrested in March on five drug and illegal weapon charges .He was subsequently released on a $ 15,000 bond .However , Wool said , the original recommended bond amount was $ 35,000 .Scott spent nearly two months in jail , and a new bond of $ 15,000 was set in late April after all but one charge were dropped by Harry Cantrell , the magistrate commissioner , or refused by the District Attorneys Office .#### Guidry accuses judges of trying to sabotage the program During an Oct. 18 joint meeting of the Criminal Justice and Budget Committees , Guidry accused the judges of trying to sabotage the program , according to a report in The Advocate .Speaking at the meeting , Lori Eville of the National Institute of Corrections questioned the constitutionality of blanket pretrial detention orders from the court , though no one mentioned Parkers order .First appearances before a magistrate typically take place within a day of arrest .But in New Orleans , felony defendants then wait 40 days on average to appear before a district court judge for arraignment .You have a 40-day period in which someone does not have the right to a non-financial release , Eville said .Guidry noted that the criminal court receives more than half of a 3 percent fee paid to the sheriff from bail bond underwriters , meaning that judges , like the underwriters , have a financial stake in the bail industry .You have to question who is shooting at them , and what their motivation is , she said .She later added , more charitably , that she hopes to work productively with the court in the future .The criminal courts budget was cut pretty severely last year , and I advocated against that and advocated that it not be cut again .It would be my hope that we can all work together to make this program the success that it has been nationally .Help us

_ See the related story from Fox8 News here ._ Sheriff Marlin Gusman is threatening to take the city to court unless it pays him 28 percent more money than last year to house New Orleans inmates .The move likely heralds yet another round of legal wrangling between the city and the sheriffs office over funding for the jail , which has been ongoing since the late 1960s prompting criminal justice reform advocates to suggest changing the way the city pays for its jail services .The city now pays Gusman $ 22.39 per inmate per day .Thats less than the state and federal prison systems pay him , with daily rates of $ 26.39 and $ 43 respectively .Gusman says the rising cost of housing the citys inmates means he needs $ 27 per inmate per day from the city to provide constitutional conditions in his jail .Thats an annual increase of $ 4.8 million , based on his projection of 2,800 city inmates next year up from 2,308 in 2009 and 2,500 projected this year .Gusman is also seeking $ 3.1 million more for court and medical services .All told , Gusman is seeking $ 7.9 million more than last years budget of $ 28.4 million , an increase of 28 percent .The Sheriffs Office hasnt seen a significant budget increase from the city since 2003 .To the sheriff , the math is simple : In 2005 , OPSO purchased a years worth of apricot halves for $ 201,725 , while in 2010 , a years worth of apricot halves cost $ 213,022 , wrote Gusman , in a letter to Mayor Mitch Landrieu on July 29 , illustrating rising cost issues .Similar price rises occurred in dairy products , meat , cheese , and even seasonings such as garlic powder .Medicine , material , service and power costs have all risen sharply since Hurricane Katrina , the sheriff wrote .It may be difficult for the city to find an extra $ 7.9 million for the sheriffs office when it is already strapped for cash Mayor Mitch Landrieu is seeking to close a $ 79 million hole by the end of this year .I think everybody believes that the Sheriffs Office is woefully under-funded , but the city is woefully under-funded , said Dane Ciolino , a legal expert at Loyola Universitys Law School .Still , Gusman says thats not his problem .Unless the City of New Orleans agrees to an increase in per diem and other payments , we will be forced to seek a legal remedy , wrote Gusman , in a July 30 letter to the citys chief administrative officer , Andy Kopplin , as part of his 2011 budget request .It wouldnt be the first time Gusman has taken the city to court over this issue .Indeed , the Sheriffs Office has done it dozens of times over the years .At the root of the ongoing dispute is that no other major city in the country pays its sheriffs for jail space with a per diem system .New Orleans daily rate originates from a lawsuit filed by the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union in 1969 , on behalf of all prisoners at the Orleans Parish Prison , asking that the city pay the Sheriffs Office sufficient money to maintain constitutional conditions .An order establishing the daily rate was added in 1989 and has been amended several times since then , most recently in 2003 , to the current rate of $ 22.39 per day .The ACLU withdrew its name from the lawsuit last year on the grounds that its original intent to improve jail conditions had ultimately been turned on its head by the per diem system .The only incentive a per diem system provides is to have more people in jail , said Michael Jacobson , director of the Vera Institute of Justice in New York .Because the more inmates you have , the more money you have .Nevertheless , the funding orders remain attached to the 1969 suit , even without a plaintiff .And the sheriffs threat to take the city to court to amend the per diem again should come as no surprise , legal experts said .Its essentially a demand letter laying the groundwork for yet another round legal squabble , Ciolino said .The problem is not that people dispute or doubt the sheriffs office needs more , the problem really is just really finding a source for funds .Now , justice reform advocates say the time has come to change the way the city pays the sheriff for jail services .For example , research suggests that over-punishing less dangerous criminals , who wouldnt be in jail elsewhere , turns them into more serious criminals by removing them from society and depriving them of employment and social ties , Jacobson said .So -LSB- in a per diem system -RSB- , youre effectively spending money to buy yourself a public safety problem , Jacobson said .And then youre on this treadmill , where no matter what you have , youre never going to have enough money to run a safe jail .I would argue that in New Orleans , you need a smaller jail , but with more money , Jacobson continued .The sheriff may well need $ 32 a day , but it shouldnt be on a per diem .It should be based on whos in jail , and what do those people need ?Jon Wool , director of the Vera Institutes New Orleans office , said that its up to the city as much as the sheriff to look at ending the per diem funding structure .The sheriffs demand comes as Landrieu convenes a Criminal Justice Working Group to examine the size of a new jail , and as Gusman spends $ 11 million in FEMA money on a temporary jail to house 400 inmates .The sheriff also was threatened with legal action by the Department of Justice in September 2009 , if he didnt take action to improve conditions inside his jails to meet constitutional standards .The sheriff told The Lens in a recent interview that he has met the Department of Justice conditions , but his office has yet to turn over documentation to prove it .Advocates for a smaller jail say the sheriff needs to be more transparent about why he has so many inmates in his jail , before the city agrees to write him a larger check for each of those inmates .The sheriff has capacity for about 3,552 inmates , and had 3,170 inmates on September 10 , according to statistics provided by his office .The problem is he hasnt explained to anybody why he has as many people in there he has , why he needs to have the number of beds he has , said Marjorie Esman , executive director of the Louisiana ACLU .Until hes provided answers to those questions , the City Council shouldnt just give the amount , blank dollar he wants .He needs to explain what he really needs and why he needs it .Gusman did not respond to a request for comment .The city is saying little about the matter .We have received the Sheriffs request and are considering it as we work to develop the 2011 budget , Landrieu spokesman Ryan Berni said in a written response to an interview request on this story by The Lens and our partners at Fox8 News .Help us report this story Report an

Though top city officials have convened agroup to advise on a controversial proposed expansion of the Orleans Parish Prison , the groups meetingsare not open to the public because it is not a formal working group , Mayor Mitch Landrieus director of intergovernmental affairs told The Lens .The Landrieu administration has convened different stakeholders to gather and share information , Director of Intergovernmental Affairs Michael Sherman said in an interview .He said the group will present findings to the mayors top staff and Deputy Mayor Andy Kopplin will study the issue .It is unclear how , beyond its freedom to ignore public meetings law , the group differs from a formal working group .Internal group correspondenceincludes references to the group as a working group .Landrieu assembled the group in response to public outcry over Sheriff Marlin Gusmans plan to expand the jail from about 3,800 beds to about 5,800 beds .In recent weeks , the group has met once to begin addressing concerns and making recommendations to the City Council , which will need to give final approval to a zoning measure before Gusman can proceed .When the jail expansion came up July 1 on the councils agenda , members of the council said they want to hear findings from the group before making a decision .The group is comprised of council staffers , law enforcement officials , U.S. Department of Justice representatives , representatives from the nonprofits VOTE-Nola , Safe Streets , Access to Justice and the Vera Institute as well as representatives from Loyola University and Tulane University Law Schools .Kopplin led the first meeting .Its unclear if the mayor or the police chief have much control over the process , other than speaking from their respective pulpits .Gusman can finance the building project using a combination of FEMA money and bond money issued after voters approved a jail-building referendum by a 3-to-1 margin in 2008 .Opponents to the plan say the ballot measure was introduced at the last minute and voters were not informed when they checked yes in 2008 .One person who was at the first meeting , Allen James , the Executive Director of Safe Streets , said that while he does want the meetings to be held in accordance with public meetings laws , his primary concern is that the city offficials make a informed decision .Making sure that the organizations that have technical information are able to present that information to decision-makers is the most important issue , he said .Another group member , Jon Wool , the director of the Vera Institutes New Orleans office , said that in addition to discussions about the capacity of the jail , -LSB- The -RSB- working group and advisory group have been expressly tasked with making recommendations about a critical issue that should be addressed in tandem .That issue , Wool said , is How should the city fund the operating cost of the jail ?And that is one question taxpayers should have a right to weigh in on , he said .City officials have said the public spoke when the ballot referendum was approved in 2008 and will have a chance again , when the council votes on the zoning measure .The public process will continue then , said Sherman .A date has not yet been selected for the council vote .Help us report this story Report an error The Lens ' donors and partners may be mentioned or have a stake in the stories we cover .
