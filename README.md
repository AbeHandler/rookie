Rookie is an experimental search engine developed at [The Lens](http://www.thelensnola.org "The Lens") in New Orleans through the Knight Prototype Fund. It tries to augment traditional search by providing a semantic timeline alongside search results.

Rookie requires Elastic Search 1.5.2. You should download and run elastic search (see docs from the company) before running rooking.

Gotta install this thing, which is not in pip: https://github.com/dat/pyner
