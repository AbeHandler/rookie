Rookie is an experimental search engine developed at [The Lens](http://www.thelensnola.org "The Lens") in New Orleans through the Knight Prototype Fund. It tries to augment traditional search by providing a semantic timeline alongside search results.

Rookie requires Elastic Search 1.5.2. You should download and run Elastic Search before running Rookie. There is lots of documentation on how to do this on the company's website.
