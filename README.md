### Rookie

Imagine you are a new reporter just assigned to a beat. Or a community activist interested in researching a certain political figure or government agency. News archives have lots of information that can help bring you up to speed. But reading thousands (or millions) of articles returned from a search enginge takes lots of time. So you'll have to read for a while before you understand what is going on. Rookie, an experimental search engine developed at [The Lens](http://www.thelensnola.org "The Lens"), is designed to help you with this task. 

[Abe Handler](https://www.abehandler.com "Abe Handler") did most of the research, designing and code for Rookie. He got lots of conceptual help from [Steve Myers](https://twitter.com/myersnews "Steve Myers") and [Brendan O'Connor](http://brenocon.com "Brendan O'Connor").
