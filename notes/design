search http://localhost:5000/medviz?q=levee. drilling down to Jay Lapere is GREAT. So showing the original text is great when possible.

if you are in browse mode.... just Q... no F or T.... too many docs... you can show facets...

1/5/15 -- There are essentially two facet lists: F and T(binned). It makes sense for one to be a vertical list and one to be horizontal list. Why is the time a vertical -- but the x axis of the time graph is a vertical? Also: do you need the chart? You could bin the chart and click region for navigation.

So one issue w/ a horizontal list of timebin buttons under chart is that they are headings for subfacets. English is read L to R, not top to bottom. But traditional japanese...

Time is ordinal. Space is ordinal? Maybe the Rookie argument is ordinal + facets > IR.

Implementation: if just Q seleted (no F or T) then bin the chart into invisible regions. Clicking region will limit to the date range. Hover will show the region. Because you should just be able to click on zoom. 

Analogy w/ color pickers? Chunking time is better than giving 10 zillion options. But there should be an advanced color picker. 

Buttons should be check marks? and should be on L side. Time bins on top.
