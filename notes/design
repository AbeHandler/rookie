search http://localhost:5000/medviz?q=levee. drilling down to Jay Lapere is GREAT. So showing the original text is great when possible.

if you are in browse mode.... just Q... no F or T.... too many docs... you can show facets...

1/5/15 -- There are essentially two facet lists: F and T(binned). It makes sense for one to be a vertical list and one to be horizontal list. Why is the time a vertical -- but the x axis of the time graph is a vertical? Also: do you need the chart? You could bin the chart and click region for navigation.

So one issue w/ a horizontal list of timebin buttons under chart is that they are headings for subfacets. English is read L to R, not top to bottom. But traditional japanese...

Time is ordinal. Space is ordinal? Maybe the Rookie argument is ordinal + facets > IR.

Implementation: if just Q seleted (no F or T) then bin the chart into invisible regions. Clicking region will limit to the date range. Hover will show the region. Because you should just be able to click on zoom. 

1/7/15 - Don't give options to set own T. Use yr/mo/dy. Analogy w/ color pickers? Chunking time is better than giving 10 zillion options. But there should be an advanced color picker. 

Buttons should be check marks? and should be on L side. Time bins on top.

1/8/15 - See detail.png. I think need another layer of facets to R of year to make this coherent.

1/9/15 - not all snippets need to be the same size. If something is REALLY important can get more airtime. Worrying about faceted drill down. https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-vs-deep-hierarchy/
If you do away with an IR system, then you will have TONS of docs to read. so really need facets. 

1/15/15 -- there might be a way to be less heuristic about the heuristics by using document frequency. more freq == better?

1/24/15 -- promoting binned facets to global is great b/c even if algo fails, user can promote minor ones... so even if does not fit in global, it still is useful. can just click to promote.

2/2/15 -- precision, recall and uis. hypothesis: you basically can't fail.

2/16/16 Don't compare Rookie to IR system. Graph. Over a short duration?
